transcending care

 live site:  https://transcending-care.herokuapp.com/

description

transcending care is a self care app that centers the voices of transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming folks. Users have the capability of creating a user account and sharing/viewing self care 'tiles' on different ways people in our community practice self care.

languages/tools used: html, css, javascript, ejs, express, mongoose, mongo, mongod, github, heroku, [MEN STACK]

bugs/technical difficulties

a few minor css issues, for example the footer doesn't stay at the bottom of the page and will render behind other items on the site if they overlap. The site isn't very responsive on mobile devices.

things I will improve

- make it so you can only edit or delete the self care tiles you create, and only you can edit your user information.
- add administrative capabilities so I'm the only one capable of deleting other users or self care posts.
- be able to create a forgot your username/ password set up.
- connect the two models together so you know which user added which tile.
- the ability to like or dislike and comment on tiles.
- the ability to have a favorite button, so if you like one of the tiles you can add it to your favorites page.
